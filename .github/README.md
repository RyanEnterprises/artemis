## INSTALLATION

### GitHub Releases Page (Recommended)

Navigate to the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/RyanEnterprises/artemis/releases) and download the latest release (or a previous release if your're that wacky).
At the moment, we only support windows, but we plan to support macOS and Linux in the future.
 (If you're really savvy, you can compile for Linux yourself)

### Trunk Builds (Experimental) (Not Recommended)

For people who love bugs and the bleeding edge.
This build is updated **AT LEAST** once per day (of active developemt) and is the result of that day's work. Navigate to [bin](https://github.com/RyanEnterprises/artemis/tree/main/bin) and download the latest release from there.
